In this example  [[file:~/Dropbox/notesy/Carver%20Mead.txt::*Alternate%20world%20view][Nature of Light]], I'm clearly seeing two things

** Problem One: Non-Hungry Collapse

First -- that the problem I have with Org-Modes way of handling layout is that I don't like how -- when I want to break into a subgroup -- I can't ever return to the parent group 

basically, if I Indent below

*** such as with this indent

I can put examples in here

but there is not longer any way that I can continue my train of thought from above...

*** Why this is a feature not a bug..

It means that I don't have signal in any way when I want to return to the parent -- it just can't happen.  So there isn't a signal for ending the fold

** Feature One : Radio Links

Nice aspect of radio-links, is that if you want to get rid of one in org-mode, it is as simple as just deleting the radio-link and then reloading the page
